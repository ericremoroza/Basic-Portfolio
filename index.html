            <p>
                My name is Eric Remoroza. I am currently a student at Georgia Tech, enrolled in the coding boot camp.
                I graduated from Berry College in May 2018 with a Bachelor of Science in Creative Technologies, which is
                an interdisciplinary field combining computation, design and art. Additionally, I work part-time as a co-host on Airbnb.
            </p>
            <p>
                My hobbies include walking my dog, karaoke and air travel. After completing the coding boot camp, I'm aspiring to work as
                a UX/UI developer at Delta Air Lines.
